Shared repo for predicting JPsych badges


Learn about badges and see if we can automate this process (since its currently based on reviewer manual curation). 

Here (https://osf.io/8kt4b/wiki/home/) is the page describing How they scored the methods sections for badges in the psychology journals, with the detailed flowchart here (https://osf.io/hwtb6/) and list of rules here (https://osf.io/4rf3v/). 

We can refer to these rules for our scoring system and automated badge calling.
